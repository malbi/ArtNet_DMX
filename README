This code is an example of using the pigpio library DMA I/O feature to generate DMX512 250k bit signal
directly from the Raspberry Pi.
You will need some sort of differential driver IC, code is designed to drive MAX485 based mdoules.
If you are using an off the shelf module then power it from the RPI 5v but remove the pullup resistors
on the RO,RE,DE an DI lines, the rpi is not 5v tolerant.

USAGE

Two programs are available 'rpi_dmaio_dmx512_cycle_test' and 'rpi_dmaio_dmx512_cycle_channels'. The channels one is the more useful.

rpi_dmaio_dmx512_cycle_test is written to be as simple as possible to show the technique for programmers, but as a utility it is pretty useless.
It cycles all 512 DMX channels between values of 0 and 255, the snag is a lot of fixtures (dmx512 devices) have extra channels that are not 
lights, they have features or master faders for example. Setting all channels to the same value will probably give confusing results. 
This code is a good starting point if you want to write your own DMX code using my code as a base.

pi_dmaio_dmx512_cycle_channels is a utility that can set dmx channels to a fixed value or cycle dmx channels.

The syntax is

# ./pi_dmaio_dmx512_cycle_channels arguments are multiple CHANNEL=VALUE pairs. 

A special value of 400 is used to indicate a cycling value (starts and 0 and climbs to 255 then back down to zero).

Lets take a real light I have here as an example. It has 4 useful channels 1,2,3 and 4. Channel 1 is master fade, channels 2,3 and 4 are Red 
Green and Blue, Channel 5 is some strobe nonsense, channels 6 and 7 do some automated fade thing I have never used. To make this fixture work
I need to set channel 1 to 255, then set and R,G,B value on channels 2,3 and 4 and ensure all other channels are 0.

I have given this fixture a DMX ID of 1

To cycle just green on this fixture I set master fade on channel 1 to 255 and cycle channel 2 :

# ./pi_dmaio_dmx512_cycle_channels 1=255 2=400

This will send all 512 DMX channels, most will be zero, except channel 1 that will always be 255 and channel 2 that will start as 0 and count 
up to 255, then count back down to zero.

To cycle red green and blue

# ./pi_dmaio_dmx512_cycle_channels 1=255 2=400 3=400 4=400

And so on ... This is all it does, but it is an example user mode driver rather than a useful application. With luck other people will include 
this code in their lighting systems/projects to allow more useful functionality.
