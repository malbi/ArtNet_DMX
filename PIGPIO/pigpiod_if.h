   pulsewidth: 0 (off), 500 (most anti-clockwise) - 2500 (most clockwise).

   The selected pulsewidth will continue to be transmitted until
   changed by a subsequent call to set_servo_pulsewidth().

   The pulsewidths supported by servos varies and should probably be
   determined by experiment. A value of 1500 should always be safe and
   represents the mid-point of rotation.

   You can DAMAGE a servo if you command it to move beyond its limits.

   OTHER UPDATE RATES:

   This function updates servos at 50Hz.  If you wish to use a different
   update frequency you will have to use the PWM functions.

   Update Rate (Hz) 50   100  200  400  500
   1E6/Hz        20000 10000 5000 2500 2000

   Firstly set the desired PWM frequency using set_PWM_frequency().

   Then set the PWM range using set_PWM_range() to 1E6/Hz.
   Doing this allows you to use units of microseconds when setting
   the servo pulse width.

   E.g. If you want to update a servo connected to gpio 25 at 400Hz

   set_PWM_frequency(25, 400);
   set_PWM_range(25, 2500);

   Thereafter use the set_PWM_dutycycle() function to move the servo,
   e.g. set_PWM_dutycycle(25, 1500) will set a 1500 us pulse.
