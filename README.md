# ArtNet_DMX
Artnet to DMX converter using a Raspberry Pi


Git Use:

first time:
git clone address_of_repo_on_git

then:
git pull
git add -A
git commit -m "message of the commit"
git push origin master


The code is based on a Jonathan Andrews project available at this address:
http://www.jonshouse.co.uk/rpidmx512.cgi

This project is not a released and is in development, also it is my first real Git project so do not expect a clean repository (for the moment).
